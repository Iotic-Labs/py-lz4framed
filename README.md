# Overview

This is an [LZ4](http://lz4.org)-frame compression library for Python v3.2+ (and 2.7+), bound to Yann Collet's [LZ4 C implementation](https://github.com/lz4/lz4).


# Installing / packaging
```shell
# To get from PyPI
pip3 install py-lz4framed

# To only build extension modules inline (e.g. in repository)
python3 setup.py build_ext -i

# To build & install globally
python3 setup.py install
```
**Notes**

- The above as well as all other python3-using commands should also run with v2.7+
- This module is also available via [Anaconda (conda-forge)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/py-lz4framed) (with binaries for Linux, OSX and Windows)
- PyPI releases are signed with the [Iotic Labs Software release signing key](https://iotic-labs.com/iotic-labs.com.asc)


# Usage
Single-function operation:
```python
import lz4framed

compressed = lz4framed.compress(b'binary data')

uncompressed = lz4framed.decompress(compressed)
```
To iteratively compress (to a file or e.g. BytesIO instance):
```python
with open('myFile', 'wb') as f:
    # Context automatically finalises frame on completion, unless an exception occurs
    with Compressor(f) as c:
        try:
            while (...):
               c.update(moreData)
        except Lz4FramedNoDataError:
            pass
```
To decompress from a file-like object:
```python
with open('myFile', 'rb') as f:
    try:
        for chunk in Decompressor(f):
           decoded.append(chunk)
    except Lz4FramedNoDataError:
        # Compress frame data incomplete - error case
        ...
```
See also [lz4framed/\_\_main\_\_.py](lz4framed/__main__.py) for example usage.

# Documentation
```python
import lz4framed
print(lz4framed.__version__, lz4framed.LZ4_VERSION, lz4framed.LZ4F_VERSION)
help(lz4framed)
```

# Command-line utility
```shell
python3 -mlz4framed
USAGE: lz4framed (compress|decompress) (INFILE|-) [OUTFILE]

(De)compresses an lz4 frame. Input is read from INFILE unless set to '-', in
which case stdin is used. If OUTFILE is not specified, output goes to stdout.
```


# Tests

## Static
This library has been checked using [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) and [pylint](http://www.pylint.org), using a modified configuration - see _pylint.rc_ and _flake8.cfg_.

## Unit
```shell
python3 -m unittest discover -v .
```

# Why?
The only existing lz4-frame interoperable implementation I was aware of at the time of writing ([lz4tools](https://github.com/darkdragn/lz4tools)) had the following limitations:

- Incomplete implementation in terms of e.g. reference & memory leaks on failure
- Lack of unit tests
- Not thread safe
- Does not release GIL during low level (de)compression operations
- Did not address the requirements for an external project
